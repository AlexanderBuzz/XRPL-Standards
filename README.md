# XRP ledger Standards / Drafts

To ensure interoperability between XRP (ledger) applications, tools, platforms, pursuing a great user experience, it would be best if the
community (developers, users) agree on certain implementations.

This repository will be used to discuss, draft and set standards regarding implementations like:

  - The **formatting of information** (like [signed transactions](https://github.com/xrp-community/standards-drafts/issues/4))
  - The **URI formats to deep link** to apps (like [destination accounts + tags, payments](https://github.com/xrp-community/standards-drafts/issues/3), etc.)
